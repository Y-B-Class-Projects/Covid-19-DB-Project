# Covid 19 DataBase Project

In this project we built a Windows app that displays data about Covid-19. In the main window of the application there is a dashboard that shows data about the corona in Israel.

The software takes the data from the official website of the Government of Israel ([Data GOV](https://info.data.gov.il/datagov/home/)) and saves it on a local database and then displays it in the UI.
